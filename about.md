I'm a software developer specialising in UX working in Melbourne with a strong international portfolio. I've contracted in Australia and the UK (London) on projects big and small for various clients during the past 5 years and thrive in fresh, challenging and changing environments.

You can see work that I've done and some industry opinions I have about UX in the travel industry at <https://usabletravel.com>.

Previously as an active member of the Drupal.org community, I've contributed patches to various contributed projects including Acquia Commons. I also frequent Drupal issue queues posting bug-reports, work-arounds and replies.
